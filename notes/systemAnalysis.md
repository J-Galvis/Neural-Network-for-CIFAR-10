## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of the CIFAR-10 neural network training system, covering its architecture, components, and capabilities.

## System Architecture

The system consists of 5 main modules designed for different aspects of neural network training and distributed computing:

- **Block 2**: 32→64 channels, with batch normalization  
- **Block 3**: 64→128 channels, with batch normalization
- **Global Average Pooling**: Replaces large fully connected layers
- **Fully Connected**: 128→64→32→10 with dropout (0.5)

**Key Architectural Improvements:**
- Batch normalization after each convolutional layer
- Global average pooling to reduce parameters

## System Evolution

### Original Network (Legacy)
```python
# Simple architecture
self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(3, 6, 5)      # Basic convolution
self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(6, 16, 5)     # Basic convolution
self.fc1 = nn.Linear(16 * 5 * 5, 120)  # Large FC layer
# Basic SGD training, batch size 4
```

**Limitations:**
- Minimal feature extraction capability
- No regularization
- Basic optimization
- Small batch size (4)
- No advanced training techniques

### Current Network (Improved)
```python
# Modern architecture with improvements
self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(3, 32, 3, padding=1)    # Better filter size
self.bn1 = nn.BatchNorm2d(32)                  # Batch normalization
self.global_avg_pool = nn.AdaptiveAvgPool2d(1) # GAP instead of large FC
self.dropout = nn.Dropout(0.5)                 # Regularization
# AdamW + OneCycleLR, effective batch size 128
```

**Improvements:**
- 533% increase in feature extraction capacity (6→32 initial filters)
- Batch normalization for training stability
- Global average pooling reduces parameters by ~90%
- Advanced optimization strategies
- 32x larger effective batch size
- Mixed precision training support
